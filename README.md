# Scrap-Project_Java
A scrap project to practice JavaFX.

As I develop my programming skills and learn the languages of these machines, I plan to keep documents of this journey.
May it serve everyone well, and may the future look back to see improvement.

This project will be used to allow others to see the work that I experiment on. Any suggestions are appreciated, and if an open-source project becomes a reality, then said project will be open to edits. I wish to remain a modest novice, who is taking the long road of learning to, in my opinion, develop my skills as a programmer. I will guarantee a possibility of bad logic and practice, but these mistakes will be temperary values for my keys for success.
